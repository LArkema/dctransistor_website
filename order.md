Select your board! 20% of all board sales goes towards Open Source projects that make DCTransistor possible and to DC-based Community Organizations. See the [price breakdown](#price-breakdown) below for more details.

***Orders after December 18 will not ship until early January (I am not "on that grind").***

## Pay What You Can Pricing
All DCTransistor Boards are currently pay-what-you-can so that everyone who wants a board can get one, with a range of $50-$250. I've also reduced the recommend price of standard boards to $65 to help keep the boards affordably and accessibly priced.
All purchases above $150 will go directly to a DC-based mutual aid or other community organization.

### Price Breakdown
In the spirit of providing a transparent, open source, community-minded project, here's an estimate of where your money goes for a single board (not a perfect reflection of actual costs - any changes in production price, taxes, etc. only bear on what I take home, not on what goes to Open Source Projects and Community Organizations):

 *Price is relative to the order amount paid. Number provided is based on suggested price.

***Open Source Projects***: 3% of all sales go to open source community projects powering DCTransistor - primarily the ArduinoJSON project and to Arduino, as they are the only two open source projects I directly use that accept donations.

***DC Community Organizations***: 17% of all sales go to DC mutual aid and other community organizations doing important on-the-ground work in the area. Prior contributions have gone to the DC Abortion Fund and various mutual aid networks.

### Local Pickup
Instead of having the board shipped, you can also arrange to pick it up from me in the DC area *if we're already going to be in the same place at the same time.* Basically, this is limited to 1) my friends and Columbia Heights neighbors, 2) other people regularly on the Georgetown Law Center Campus, 3) work colleagues, and 4) people at a meetup for an area group I would otherwise be attending (if this applies, I've posted about it in that group). Please read the [terms and conditions](/terms-and-privacy/#local-pickup) before selecting this option.

*You must email <a href="mailto:orders@dctransistor.com">orders@dctransistor.com</a> to arrange a pickup before selecting the option during checkout*
