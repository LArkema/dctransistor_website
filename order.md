## Pay What You Can Pricing
All DCTransistor Boards are currently pay-what-you-can so that everyone who wants a board can get one, with a range of $60-$250. I've set a recommended price of $80 which I believe fairly covers my costs, keeps the boards accessibly priced, and lets me give back to the community. 

All purchases above $150 will go directly to a DC-based mutual aid or other community organization.

### Price Breakdown
In the spirit of providing a transparent, open source, community-minded project, here's where your money goes for a $80 board:

Required Expenses:
* $20.38 to make and ship board from manufacturer
* $0.36 for individual board packaging
* $2.83* for payment processing
* $19.48* for state and local taxes
* $7.23 for upfront, R&D, and misc. expenses 

After covering costs, I'm left with $29.71 from an $80 order. Of that money:
* $2.40* (3% of all sales) goes back to the open source community projects powering DCTransistor
* $13.6* (17% of all sales) goes to DC mutual aid and other community organizations doing important on-the-ground work in the area
* $13.72* (remainder) goes to me for personal use

 *Price is relative to the order amount paid. Number provided is based on an $80 order.

### Local Pickup
Instead of having the board shipped, you can also arrange to pick it up from me in the DC area *if we're already going to be in the same place at the same time.* Basically, this is limited to 1) my friends and Columbia Heights neighbors, 2) other people regularly on the Georgetown Law Center Campus, 3) work colleagues, and 4) people at a meetup for an area group I would otherwise be attending (if this applies, I've posted about it in that group). Please read the [terms and conditions](/terms-and-privacy/#local-pickup) before selecting this option.

*You must email <a href="mailto:orders@dctransistor.com">orders@dctransistor.com</a> to arrange a pickup before selecting the option during checkout*

## Bidirectional Boards Likely in Summer-Fall 2023
I know having a board with bi-directional trains would be fantastic, and I'm planning on making one. However, I probably won't have one ready to sell until the Summer (at the earliest), and its recommended price will probably run around $100 due to higher materials costs.
