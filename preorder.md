After months of work (and delays) transforming the prototype board into a clean, finished product, the [DCTransistor Pre-Order](https://buy.stripe.com/cN2eXt3XKc0fefm9AA) is live!

The Preorder will close on 3/19/2023, and I will purchase a batch of boards during the week of 3/12 assuming a healthy number of preorders. Based on production and shipping estimates, I should receive the boards in late March / early April and be able to immediately start shipping them.

Before ordering, be sure to read and understand the [Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](/terms-and-privacy). Importantly, a power supply is *not* included.

## Pay What You Can Pricing
All DCTransistor Boards are currently pay-what-you-can so that everyone who wants a board can get one, with a range of $50-$250. I've set a recommended price of $75 which I believe fairly covers my costs, keeps the boards accessibly priced, and lets me share my love of DC with my neighbors. *All purchases above $150 will go directly to a DC-based mutual aid or other community organization*.

### Price Breakdown
For context, each board will cost around $22 to make and ship to me, another $1 or so to ship to you, and $2.48 to have your payment processed. In addition, I've put about $900 into board prototypes, supplies, and other up-front costs, so $9 from each board in my first batch of 100 will recoup those. At the recommended price point of $75, another $16.25 will go to taxes, leaving $24.25 to do as I please.

Of that $24.25 per board, $1.50 (2% of sales) will go to paying back the open source developers and maintainers who provided the libraries and other resources behind DCTransistor, $12 (16% of all sales) will go to DC mutual aid and other community organizations doing important on-the-ground work in the area, and the rest ($10.75 or 14.3% for a $75 purchase) will go to me.

### Local Pickup
Instead of having the board shipped, you can also arrange to pick it up from me in the DC area *if we're already going to be in the same place at the same time.* Basically, this is limited to 1) my friends and Columbia Heights neighbors, 2) other people regularly on the Georgetown Law Center Campus, 3) work colleagues, and 4) people at a meetup for an area group I would otherwise be attending (if this applies, I've posted about it in that group). Please read the [terms and conditions](/terms-and-privacy/#local-pickup) before selecting this option.

*You must email <a href="mailto:orders@dctransistor.com">orders@dctransistor.com</a> to arrange a pickup before selecting the option during checkout*

### Bi-Directional Boards Likely in Summer 2023
I know having a board with bi-directional trains would be fantastic, and I'm planning on making one. However, I probably won't have one ready to sell until the Summer (at the earliest), and its recommended price will probably run around $100 due to higher materials costs.
